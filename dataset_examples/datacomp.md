## DataComp-1B

DataComp-1B is a dataset with 1.4 billion image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl and subsequently filtered. DataComp-1B is derived from CommonPool, as part of [DataComp](https://github.com/mlfoundations/datacomp), a benchmark for designing multimodal datasets.
DataComp-1B comprises the best performing subset of the `xlarge` version of CommonPool found by [Gadre et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14108).
See http://datacomp.ai/ and https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14108 for details.
